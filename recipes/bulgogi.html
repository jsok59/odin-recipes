    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Bulgogi is a popular Korean dish that consists of thinly sliced beef marinated in a flavorful sauce and then grilled or stir-fried. The name "bulgogi" translates to "fire meat" or "barbecue meat" in Korean, reflecting its method of preparation.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Thinly sliced beef (such as sirloin, ribeye, or tenderloin)</li>
        <li>Soy sauce</li>
        <li>Sesame oil</li>
        <li>Garlic cloves (minced)</li>
        <li>Ginger (grated or minced)</li>
        <li>Sugar or honey</li>
        <li>Pear or apple (pureed or grated, optional)</li>
        <li>Green onions (sliced)</li>
        <li>Sesame seeds (toasted)</li>
        <li>Ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the marinade by combining soy sauce, sesame oil, minced garlic, grated ginger, sugar or honey, optional pear or apple puree/grated, sliced green onions, toasted sesame seeds, and ground black pepper in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Thinly slice the beef against the grain into bite-sized pieces.</li>
        <li>Place the sliced beef in a bowl or a resealable plastic bag.</li>
        <li>Pour the marinade over the beef, ensuring that all the pieces are well coated. If using a plastic bag, seal it tightly, removing as much air as possible.</li>
        <li>Marinate the beef in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour, or preferably overnight, to allow the flavors to meld and the beef to absorb the marinade.</li>
        <li>Preheat a grill, grill pan, or skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Remove the beef from the marinade, shaking off any excess liquid.</li>
        <li>Grill or stir-fry the beef for a few minutes on each side until it is cooked to your desired level of doneness and has a slightly charred or caramelized exterior.</li>
        <li>Transfer the cooked bulgogi to a serving plate or dish.</li>
        <li>Garnish with additional sliced green onions and toasted sesame seeds, if desired.</li>
        <li>Serve hot with steamed rice, lettuce leaves for wrapping, and various banchan (side dishes).</li>
      </ol>
