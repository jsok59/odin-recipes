    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Chicken or Vegetable Broth: 4 cups</li>
        <li>Eggs: 2 to 3 large eggs (beaten)</li>
        <li>Soy Sauce: 1 to 2 tablespoons</li>
        <li>Ginger: 1 teaspoon (freshly grated or minced)</li>
        <li>White Pepper: 1/4 teaspoon (ground)</li>
        <li>Salt: 1/4 teaspoon (optional, adjust according to taste)</li>
        <li>Cornstarch: 1 tablespoon (dissolved in 2 tablespoons of water)</li>
        <li>Green onions (Scallions): 2 to 3 stalks, thinly sliced (for garnish)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat 4 cups of chicken or vegetable broth in a pot until it simmers gently.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, beat 2 to 3 large eggs until well combined.</li>
        <li>Stir in 1 to 2 tablespoons of soy sauce and 1 teaspoon of freshly grated or minced ginger into the simmering broth.</li>
        <li>Add 1/4 teaspoon of ground white pepper to the broth for a mild peppery flavor. You can also add 1/4 teaspoon of salt if desired.</li>
        <li>Dissolve 1 tablespoon of cornstarch in 2 tablespoons of water and stir it into the broth. This will slightly thicken the soup.</li>
        <li>While stirring the broth gently in one direction, gradually pour the beaten eggs into the pot in a thin, steady stream. The eggs will cook and form delicate ribbons as they hit the hot liquid.</li>
        <li>Optional: If you prefer, you can add additional ingredients like tofu, corn kernels, peas, carrots, mushrooms, or spinach to the soup at this stage.</li>
        <li>Remove the pot from the heat once the eggs are cooked and the soup is slightly thickened.</li>
        <li>Serve the egg drop soup hot in individual bowls, garnishing with thinly sliced green onions (scallions).</li>
    </ol>
