    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the lasagna noodles according to package instructions until al dente.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat and add diced onions and minced garlic. Saut√© until they are softened and fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add the ground beef or Italian sausage to the skillet and cook until it is browned and cooked through. Break up any large chunks with a spoon.</li>
        <li>Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper. Simmer the sauce for about 15-20 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, mix the ricotta cheese, shredded mozzarella cheese, grated Parmesan cheese, beaten egg, and chopped fresh parsley. This is the cheese filling for the lasagna.</li>
        <li>Preheat your oven to the temperature specified on the lasagna noodle package instructions.</li>
        <li>Spread a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom of a baking dish.</li>
        <li>Place a layer of cooked lasagna noodles over the sauce.</li>
        <li>Spread a layer of the cheese filling over the noodles.</li>
        <li>Repeat the layers: meat sauce, noodles, and cheese filling. You can add optional vegetables between the layers if desired.</li>
        <li>Finish with a final layer of meat sauce and sprinkle grated Parmesan cheese on top.</li>
        <li>Cover the baking dish with foil and bake in the preheated oven for about 25-30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and the top is golden brown.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and let the lasagna rest for a few minutes before serving.</li>
        <li>Garnish with torn fresh basil leaves, if desired, and serve hot.</li>
